20220225_10-K_310158_part2_item8_para178:	In 2020, the company recorded an impairment charge of $ 1.6 Billion within cost of sales related to zerbaxa (ceftolozane and tazobactam) for injection, a combination antibacterial and beta-lactamase inhibitor for the treatment of certain bacterial infections. in december 2020, the company temporarily suspended sales of zerbaxa , and subsequently issued a product recall, following the identification of product sterility issues. the recall constituted a triggering event requiring the evaluation of the zerbaxa intangible asset for impairment. the company revised its cash flow forecasts for zerbaxa utilizing certain assumptions around the return to market timeline and anticipated uptake in sales thereafter. these revised cash flow forecasts indicated that the zerbaxa intangible asset value was not fully recoverable on an undiscounted cash flows basis. the company utilized market participant assumptions to determine its best estimate of the fair value of the intangible asset related to zerbaxa that, when compared with its related carrying value, resulted in the impairment charge noted above. the company also wrote-off inventory of $ 120 million to cost of sales in 2020 related to the zerbaxa recall. a phased resupply of zerbaxa was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2021.
