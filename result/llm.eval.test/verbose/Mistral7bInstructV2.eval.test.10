although we cannot presently estimate the ultimate and total financial impact of the unprecedented covid-19 pandemic, which is highly dependent on the severity and duration of the pandemic, we expect it will continue to have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations in future periods. as such, due to these uncertainties and the indeterminate length of time the pandemic will affect the hospitality industry, we took certain proactive measures to secure our liquidity position to be able to meet our obligations for the foreseeable future, which included: (i) fully drawing down on our $1.75 billion revolving credit facility; (ii) suspending dividend payments and share repurchases; (iii) implementing strict cost management measures, such as temporarily halting certain marketing programs, temporarily eliminating non-essential expenses, including capital expenditures, and reducing payroll and related costs through workforce reductions, furloughs and temporary salary reductions; (iv) consummating the april 2020 pre-sale of hilton honors points to american express for $1.0 billion in cash (the "honors points pre-sale"); (v) issuing $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes in april 2020; and (vi) issuing $1.9 billion of aggregate principal amount of senior notes in december 2020 to extend debt maturities and reduce our cost of debt by repaying certain outstanding senior notes. further, in february 2021, we issued $1.5 billion of aggregate principal amount of senior notes to continue to extend debt maturities and reduce our cost of debt by repaying additional outstanding senior notes. based on our ability to manage our liquidity position during the covid-19 pandemic, in january 2021, we repaid $250 million of the outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility. see note 22:" subsequent events" in our consolidated financial statements for additional information on these transactions.

Context:
in 2020, the covid-19 pandemic significantly impacted the global economy and strained the hospitality industry due to travel restrictions and stay-at-home directives in place at various times during the period, resulting in cancellations and significantly reduced travel around the world. the reduction in travel resulted in the complete and partial suspensions of hotel operations in many of the areas where our hotels are located at some point in time during 2020, having a material adverse impact on our results for the year ended december 31, 2020. as of february 10, 2021, 97 percent of our global hotel properties were open, while approximately 220 hotels had temporarily suspended operations. in response to this global crisis, we took actions to prioritize the safety and security of our guests, employees and owners and support our communities. during the summer, we launched hilton cleanstay and hilton eventready, which deliver a new standard of cleanliness and customer service to our properties worldwide, including for meetings and events. we also found alternative uses for certain of our hotel properties, including partnering with american express to donate up to one million hotel room nights for frontline medical professionals, and provided financial assistance to organizations helping those affected by covid-19, through our hilton effect foundation. additionally, we took certain proactive measures to secure our liquidity position to help our business withstand this uncertain time.

Context:
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt, we may be required to reduce capital expenditures or issue additional equity securities. our ability to make scheduled principal payments and to pay interest on our debt depends on our future operating performance, which is subject to general conditions in or affecting the hospitality industry that may be beyond our control. the covid-19 pandemic negatively impacted our cash flows from operations during the period, and will continue to do so for an indeterminate period of time. although our operating activities provided cash during the year ended december 31, 2020, it was primarily a result of the honors points pre-sale. we took precautions to secure our cash position, as discussed above, and expect to be able to meet our current obligations. furthermore, we do not have any material indebtedness outstanding that matures prior to june 2024.

Context:
acquisitions or investments involve significant challenges and risks and could impair our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products and ultimately could have a negative impact on our financial results. given that our resources are limited, if we pursue a particular transaction, we may limit our ability to enter into other transactions that could help us achieve our strategic objectives. if we are unable to timely complete acquisitions, including due to delays and challenges in obtaining regulatory approvals, we may be unable to pursue other transactions, we may not be able to retain critical talent from the target company, technology may evolve and make the acquisition less attractive, and other changes can take place which could reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction and negatively impact our business. for example, on february 8, 2022, nvidia and softbank announced the termination of the share purchase agreement whereby nvidia would have acquired arm from softbank. the parties agreed to terminate because of significant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction. we intend to record in operating expenses a $1.36 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at signing in september 2020. in addition, to the extent that our perceived ability to consummate acquisitions has been harmed, future acquisitions may be more difficult, complex or expensive. further, if we hold investments in publicly traded companies, they could create volatility in our results and may generate losses up to the value of the investment.

to retain critical talent from the target company, technology may evolve, making the acquisition less attractive, and other changes can take place which could jeopardize or reduce the anticipated

regulatory approvals for the deal from mexico in july 2019 and from the european commission in december 2019. in addition, the waiting period under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act of 1976, as amended, in connection with the proposed acquisition expired in may 2019. discussions with china's regulatory agency, the state administration for market regulation, are progressing and we believe the acquisition will likely close in the early part of calendar 2020. if the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances involving the failure to obtain the required regulatory approvals, we could be obligated to pay mellanox a termination fee of $350 million .", "We have in the past acquired and invested in, and may continue to acquire and invest in, other businesses that
